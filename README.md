# E-Commerce Store Tutorial

## Overview
In this project, I will build an **E-Commerce Store** with two key components:

1. **Admin Dashboard** 🛠️: Manage products, orders, and other administrative tasks.
2. **Storefront** 🛒: A user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products.

This tutorial is created by **Hira Khalid**. 👩‍💻 I am launching my own shoe product 👟, and I have created a dedicated website for it as part of this project.
